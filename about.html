            <h3> I’m 19, from Italy, my parents are from Albania. I grew up in a setting that put together two totally different cultures, so I easily adapt to whatever environment. I’ve been drawing since I was 5yo, going to art classes after school and then to an art high school.</h3>

            <p> I get inspiration from everything that happens in my life, mostly drawing myself in a very schematic way as it’s the quickest way to express my feeling without forgetting them. </p>

            <p> I think what makes me different is that I have multiple art styles. I like to experiment. I’m not able to use the same stile for all the emotions that I feel, since they’re different, they’re going to be represented in different ways; pen drawings, collages, watercolours, acrylics, oil paintings, pencil drawings.</p>

            <p class="last"> My final goal is to understand myself and my feelings by looking at what I produce. My art is something I do mostly for myself, as a journey to knowing the truth about life, my purpose on Earth. </p>
